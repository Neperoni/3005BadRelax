# Welcome to my github
### I've completed a submission to the bonus assignment for comp3005 database management 
###This project is a relational database query system, it loads in databases and then can run arbitrarily (well overflow will probably happen) nested queries on the data
###not tested extensively

github link:
https://github.com/Neperoni/3005BadRelax

instructions: 
###When the program is run, it will load all the databases in the Data folder, it assumes they are formatted correctly, so please make sure.
Theres some examples in there on how to format the data.

Next it will print some example commands I've added, and then ask for your command.

set and join are pretty untested, I don't think it will crash but I won't guarantee correct function
I have also only implemented inner join, outer, left, right, full are not implemented.

youtube link for demonstration:
