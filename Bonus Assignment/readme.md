# Welcome to my GitHub

### This repository is for the bonus assignment for COMP3005 Database Management. 

This project is a relational database query system. It loads databases and can run arbitrarily nested queries on the data

**GitHub Link:** [3005BadRelax](https://github.com/Neperoni/3005BadRelax)

### Instructions:
You must write your database data into a .txt file in the Data folder.

When the program is run, it will load all the databases in the Data folder, assuming they are formatted correctly. Please make sure to check the examples provided in the folder on how to format the data.

After loading, the program will print some example commands. You can then input your command.

- Please keep labels and database names alphanumeric, `(` and `,` are used for query processing and will cause mayhem otherwise
- `set` and `join` are relatively untested. They probably won't crash, but I can't guarantee correct function.
- Only inner join is implemented; outer, left, right, and full joins are not.

This project was an interesting experienceâ€”it's pretty much creating a compiler or a programming language.
